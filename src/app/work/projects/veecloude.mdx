## Overview

VeeCloude is a modern web-based video calling and meeting application built with Next.js. Designed to offer seamless and secure virtual communication, the platform leverages ZegoCloud’s real-time communication infrastructure to enable high-quality video and audio calls. The project focuses on ease of use, fast performance, and clean UI, making virtual meetings accessible for everyone.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Video & Audio Calls**: Integrated ZegoCloud to enable high-performance video conferencing with low latency and reliable connectivity.
- **Modern UI Components**: Utilized shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS to build a sleek, responsive user interface that works smoothly across devices.
- **Instant Room Creation**: Users can generate and join meeting rooms instantly, making the platform ideal for quick meetups and scheduled calls alike.
- **Secure Connections**: API interactions are handled using Axios to ensure secure and efficient communication between client and server.
- **User-Friendly Experience**: Minimal design and straightforward flows ensure that even non-technical users can start or join meetings without friction.



## Technologies Used

- **Next.js: For building a performant, scalable full-stack application.**
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast, responsive, and utility-first styling.
- **shadcn/ui**: For accessible and polished UI components.
- **Axios**: For handling HTTP requests and server interactions.
- **ZegoCloud**: For real-time audio/video communication with advanced media handling features.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the key challenges was implementing smooth and stable real-time communication while maintaining UI responsiveness. Managing ZegoCloud’s SDK within the Next.js framework required a deep understanding of lifecycle hooks and real-time media management. Through this project, I gained practical experience in building scalable RTC applications and handling user media in browser environments.


## Outcome

VeeCloude delivers a fast, reliable, and modern video calling experience tailored for everyday users. It showcases the power of combining modern UI libraries with robust RTC services, resulting in a user-friendly and technically solid communication tool. This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-time technologies and design clean, responsive web applications.
