## Overview

HouseHub is a full-stack real estate web application built with Next.js, aimed at simplifying property discovery and listing in popular Indian cities. The platform enables users to explore real estate options based on location, offering a smooth and intuitive browsing experience. It also supports secure user authentication and data management, making it a reliable tool for both buyers and sellers.

## Key Features

- **Property Search by Location**: Users can easily search for properties based on cities or keywords, making exploration faster and more relevant.
- **Responsive and Clean UI**: Designed using Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive layout that works seamlessly across devices.
- **Authentication and Security**: Integrated JWT (jsonwebtoken) and crypto-js for secure login and session handling.
- **Dynamic Listings**: Property listings are dynamically fetched and displayed using MongoDB, ensuring up-to-date content and smooth scalability.
- **Image Hosting with Cloudinary**: Property images are uploaded and managed via Cloudinary, ensuring fast load times and high-quality visuals.
- **User Dashboard**: Provides users with the ability to manage their listings and view saved properties in a personalized dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For SSR and full-stack development.
- **React Hooks**: For efficient component logic and state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first, responsive styling.
- **Express.js**: Backend API support for user and property operations.
- **MongoDB**: For scalable, document-based data storage.
- **Cloudinary**: For image upload, optimization, and CDN delivery.
- **jsonwebtoken & crypto-js**: For secure authentication and data encryption.

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge in this project was handling secure authentication and protecting user data, especially when integrating JWT and encryption in a full-stack environment. Managing image uploads efficiently while keeping the UI responsive also required careful Cloudinary integration. Through this project, I learned how to structure scalable backend routes in Next.js and enhance the user experience through real-time interactions and feedback.

## Outcome

HouseHub offers a streamlined platform for discovering and managing real estate listings in India. It successfully bridges frontend responsiveness with backend reliability, resulting in a smooth experience for both casual browsers and serious property seekers. The project highlights my ability to build secure, full-stack applications with a focus on real-world usability.
